### A Pirate Walks Into A Bar

You ask pirate 0 about a man, but he tells you to ask another pirate (a pirate between 0 and 5000), who then tells you to ask another pirate. Soon you realize that you are going in a loop of asking the same pirates.
Write a program to figure out how many pirates are involved once you land in a loop. The loop does not necessarily involve the first pirate you ask.
